Interviewer
yes I was thinking if you just want to tell me a little bit about yourself and when you went on Parental even and how long you decided to be away for
Volunteer
I went on Parental leave on the 31st of October 2022
Volunteer
and and then had my baby on the 16th of November he was a bit late and I took the full year off yeah okay
Interviewer
and was that at your current organization so the core partnership yeah
Volunteer
I've been with them for a long time and yeah
Interviewer
wonderful well sorry about that could you describe your role at your organization at the time of your before and after
Volunteer
I went off my tattoo was recruitment partner so recruitment consulted and effectively and when I came back there was a promotion which was good to direct her and recruitment Partners
Interviewer
do you what do you feel like at your organization was it a great kind of attitude towards parental leave where other employees going on Parental leave it as similar time and
Volunteer
to give you the background in a very small company so this is the seven of us and I was like actually the first person to go on my tent leave ever yeah yeah for the business so but yeah I think there was a great attitude and I mean I don't know whether it was because I've been there a long time but yeah there were really good about it the parentals of leave package before was just touched her but they had for me so that was good and so yeah I'd say
Interviewer
was it did you have any nerves about being the first one did you feel like you were kind of the the test the tester in a way
Volunteer
I think there were quite good about and has nothing and hunting the Packers himself by the hen a saw I would have to sort of push for that yeah yeah I'm gonna start straight in London not
Interviewer
um would you say that did you have any primary concerns about you know oh I'm gonna go on maternity leave these are my concerns for maybe my role or for being away for a long time or did you have any concerns prior to going on leave
Volunteer
I suppose I did think that you know when I'm gone they realize the one needs me anymore so saying yes yeah yeah I suppose that was the main thing also maybe how would work we saw childcare and you know having time with the baby
Interviewer
I went back how did you feel that you approached the concern for example of oh will they need me when I come back even if I'd be a little jokingly you know I think we all have that yeah
Volunteer
and probably just putting in the back of my mind really because there's not much he can do it I would love to take the full year so even though it was there as a thought like didn't make me want to come back and did
Interviewer
from your organization reach out to you to put up a good plan for how to you know maybe stay connected while you were in leave or a plan before you left on how you're going to re-enter
Volunteer
so we still discussed I mean obviously we discussed that I was gonna take this for four year off and about potentially using kit days yeah yeah and and I did use some of those days maybe a couple I think of a couple of months before I returned as well but yeah with the words of conversations before I left really about how that would work
Interviewer
do you feel like it did make a difference or do you almost feel like it it was more as like a a cushion to kind of just feel better at the time or did you feel like it actually provided you with the kind of security or kind of the feeling that you needed to to come back with you know confidence
Volunteer
I think it was nice to see again you know catch up on whether we're up to I didn't really do much of work actual why when I went back on those days it was more so socials and meet things and things that we did and but yeah so I was good to have that contact really and I think having had that experience of things of next time I go off hopefully I would maybe be more organized about when I do those days so I think it's more efficient for the company and you know where there are and whether the employees are at and for me as well yeah
Interviewer
you would say that maybe the the keeping in touch days where more beneficial in the way of reminding people that I am here I'm coming back and then all maybe being updated about recent you know development within the organization exactly yeah yeah I did notice or when I when I found you I saw your LinkedIn post and your little article that you had ridden and and I know that you mentioned you know at the top you said one of the top tips is you know know your rights do you think the keeping in touch days do you think that that is something that people are aware of or know how to use them properly
Volunteer
probably know and I think is quite they really how they work and I think is some employers discretion how they get paid and get paid for them so it could be clearer probably but yes I think for example they don't have to pay you for a full day unless you do a full day's work but obviously you know to have to our own child care for that day you know it might not be worth it for people to do it unless it's paid as a full day's work so even if they don't get to do the full day but
Interviewer
yeah so it so while you were on leave would you say that you that you were the one it was very much on your your side to to stay in touch and to to you know let your organization know that I'm here I'm coming back or did you reach out to you at some point and ask things are okay you know nothing with the baby is you know everything's going smoothly do you feel like there was a support and understanding that this period in your life might you know be more difficult than maybe you thought or things might not have gone exactly like planned do you feel like they reach out to you and understood that you know you might have things that you needed to bring up
Volunteer
I think there were quite communicative and I felt like they were working for me to sort of return and they did check in and sort of invited me to things so I suppose towards the beginning of the of the leaves that maybe I wasn't able to attend but they still are still sort of invited yeah and yeah so I'd say there were the work work communicative as well okay and so kept me and update with those things that were happening with with any major sort of development
Interviewer
yeah
Volunteer
get me update it
Interviewer
good so clear communication and often having communication about things yeah
Volunteer
wouldn't say Toten because I probably wouldn't like that I like I wouldn't want one yeah my blood yes I'd say yeah every couple of months maybe yeah every few months a little check in yeah
Interviewer
and that's a good point too that you thought like it was an appropriate amount yeah
Volunteer
I don't want them to be constantly harassing right
Interviewer
you're on me would you have felt comfortable saying that this is too much this is too little in a situation like that
Volunteer
not but maybe I wouldn't have been as responsive yeah
Volunteer
it was yeah too much
Interviewer
you feel like you encounter anything any challenges that you feel like could have helped your organization could have helped with during your parental or was it a good distance and they did and you know like we said inappropriate amount of communication was there anything that you feel like all in this particular incident it would have been nice to have some more support even if it wasn't them right in your face being how are you doing you know is there any kind of maybe more discreet support that you would have wanted
Volunteer
don't think so really know I mean yeah I think the only thing that would have done like it could have done better trust would be you know offering and even more and hands to attendee package but yeah
Interviewer
did you feel have you felt comfortable like expressing that or has it not been important enough I guess for you to
Volunteer
well yeah so it was pretty good that they offered the enhancement they did yeah and so being a small company and being the first of person to go on my tentatively and I thought that was fairy so I didn't I didn't really push for more but that would be sort of you know above and beyond so if it was better yeah
Interviewer
when would you say during your parental leave did you start thinking about work again and start feeling maybe stressed about it or you know did you have any of those moments where you you kind of debate it back and forth like oh should I should I go back earlier or should I you know should I what should I do with my time going forward was it always a clear thing for you to go back to your role go back to your organization you know
Volunteer
I did know that was gonna go back I would say maybe three or four months probably like before going back I started thinking more about it and I had to decide so how I'll see I would return because in the end I used my accrued on your Leaf to go back four days a week but still be on sort of full-time salary and I did that for like six the first offer six months I think so for November to to end of May I was on my base six months yeah I was doing four days and then since June I've been full-time so properly full-time yeah and but yeah having to think about because I think other people for example take their annual leave at the end of the my tent even have like an extra month off or whatever but also be nice to have a more sort of faced return
Interviewer
and was that communication again with your organization at some point where you said okay I'm ready to you know with even with the with the with the catch-up day and or staying in touch day where you went in and it was on your your timetable I guess of saying oh now I'm ready can I come in can we also discuss more about my return re-entering the organization my role what is expected of me what what do you expect of the organization tell me a little bit about that process as well yeah I think it was in one of my keeping in touch days that we discussed
Volunteer
I'll talk about the promotion so that was good and then I think previously we had discussed me and coming back on so four days using manually and the word pretty sort of happy with that I think we just had to sort of find a day that which day of the week would sort of work best for both parties really and but yeah they were pretty good about it as I said about from this of compromise on the day where to find a day that worked both yeah
Interviewer
that's great and so while you returned or while you were coming back I assume that you had the expectations of what you had put up as a plan but also maybe your own you know maybe not very maybe some subtle expectations of just like oh I think this is gonna happen do you feel like you came back to to your expectations and that yeah it was it was the way that you had kind of hoped and expected it to be coming back
Volunteer
and I think my role I think of the recruitment Consultants of role is is quite standard really so it was pretty much what I expected and I think the only sort of thing that changed was through the promotion I had some sort of additional responsibilities and areas that I would look at so that was the only and change really but I think I did like having those changes because as I said I've been more awful for a long time so it's good to have you know some sort of change and yeah it was pretty much what I expected really
Interviewer
you well that's that's good and you mentioned you know the promotion or they had some sort of advancement did you did you feel like for you it was equally an opportunity for you as it was for maybe other employees that you're going to say did you feel coming back in that you know you're you you're taking off for you where you left and you had the same you know same what's the word that I'm looking for
Interviewer
yes certain point as as your other employees at your organization
Volunteer
rule I think pretty much I think it's difficult because of the not having been doing the role for 12 months you don't have a sort of pipeline of work that other people would have that would be and would have been doing this with role continuously burning it is not the sort of employers yeah faltering is just not having been working you don't have that pipeline of sort of income and placements that you would have been making yeah if you were working continuously
Interviewer
so you thought vary from what I understand you felt very as prepared I guess as you could be to return but then all so very motivated to
Volunteer
because of the yeah promotion in that change yeah that's good
Interviewer
and and that of course like you mentioned had something to do with you having had that role and being in the organization for a long time prior to your leave but then all so coming back and just maybe wanting that change wanting that advancement I guess do you think that was all so you striped for that as a sort of did you feel any pressure to have to prove yourself even if it's to yourself but did you feel pressure of wanting to advance for the sake of you know here I am I can do this and I can be a be a mother and I can you know advanced in my career I can juggle both do you feel like there was that pressure
Volunteer
don't think as much I don't think that's much I think I did feel like I wanted to prove myself in the news of roles that to come on yeah and I felt like in my previous role I had sort of proof myself so yeah I Think It's tricky because as I said because I hadn't had that pipeline obviously my targets and being part-time had gone so the window but there were so good about and obviously understanding and but I would say if anything I think being a mother put everything in perspective and I would say I'll probably wouldn't get as stressed about being the best that my job if that sounds bad but yeah yeah I think my priority now is my child so
Interviewer
well that's that's great for me to hear because I do have some questions about you know especially for first-time parents that you must feel a sort of changed in your identity or change in just your priorities in life if yeah you touched a little bit upon that but would you mind just tell me a little bit more about that says I myself have not gone through that change in my life how would you say that you know becoming a mother maybe puts your career or puts even yourself you you change that a little bit of your identity or your feeling of life I guess yeah
Volunteer
but say I was never so stupidly I want to have a good job and like make my money and all that but I was never I don't know how to say like and super career minded us pose I don't know like I would always have I was always able to keep a good work-life balance I wasn't one of those people that you know it's all about work
Interviewer
and
Volunteer
else and so that was always there and I think I would get more I would get more stressed about sort of hitting targets and all those things before and maybe place value more value on that and before I had my child and as in terms of you know the value of me has passed in placing more value on whether I hit my targets and yeah you know how did that my job but yeah things have been my child and probably wouldn't do that as much as I think and it doesn't feel like it has such a big important for us yeah for me yeah
Interviewer
it sounds like you as your personality you know there's nothing dramatic you know you're not an extreme on either yeah yeah which is good for me to know because you know personality you know matters a lot in this in this scenario too of you know returning and coming back and in the maybe change their priorities and you mention a little bit about work life balance has that changed a lot for you coming back has your organization been open and asked you you know about flexible working hours or you know what has that look like for you both before but then also now and did you reach out to the organization about this or the day you know were they aware of maybe you wanting some changes
Volunteer
working from home and everything obviously that that's been a game changer so the company is policies of doing three days in the office and to from high and then we've agreed that I do to days in the office and three from home so after having the baby and that was the first place on me flexible working and over request that was not formally and we're just sort of discussed it but and then they I was and that we work where already well as of reduced since the pandemic and the Never sort of went back so we do a four hours are 10 to 4 and then you can do sort of 9 to 400 to your 935 lots of thing so that we're pretty reduced anyway and where is our contractual hours are 9 to 5:30 for example but yeah so we do a bit less and that works I mean even when I'm in the office of get back normal time and like some time with with my child before you go to bed and stuff so
Interviewer
have you just in within your organization for the also outside have you encountered any like social or cultural expectations regarding parental leave or you know when when you when you made the announcement that I'm you know having a child and things like that do you feel like there was some sort of expectations of you
Volunteer
say that maybe they would have been a warrior of whether or would come back yeah and expectations I don't know really I can't source for them but yeah suppose the mile always be the worry of I don't know maybe you won't be as interested in this role and yeah maybe one go back but yeah
Volunteer
wasn't sufficiently yeah yeah
Interviewer
that's it I am quite interested in here about that because I've been you know in Sweden which is of course sent more similar to the UK but then I've been in the in the United States I don't
Volunteer
how they're doing the US
Interviewer
and so so it's very interesting to me to just hear you know are their expectations do you in some like in any way feel like there's pressure of like all maybe someone in your organization was like how this was not the right time for this to happen or or maybe the expectations that it's going to be about harder for you to become a parent then you know kind of the maybe even my questions to you right now just like how did your priorities change had this happen and you're kind of just like oh you know it has changed but it hasn't been a dramatic maybe as people might think yeah yeah so so I'm just curious about about that if if you feel like people have asked you questions about this in a way that maybe you're like oh well it hasn't been as dramatic you know
Volunteer
I suppose that we're interested to solve the child care and how that would work but but yeah nothing sort of extreme and we were organized and obviously everything in place yeah before returning yeah
Interviewer
just on your I guess personal time where did you explore external support resources from from outside of your organization at this time in terms of intercept you know becoming a parent and and maybe because I know that there are example for example coaches that coach people returning from parental leave or or you know about child care
Volunteer
not really we did do an NCT course when I was pregnant and and submit local couples that were expecting around the same time so it was good to have that pair support network and obviously you know here in what they're doing with work and all that stuff but not and so professional yes yeah how pretty
Interviewer
and so you you felt very much supported you didn't feel like you were lacking any sort of support from from where you felt like you needed to have external support from anywhere you felt like you have communicated with your organization they had understood you it was respected it was smooth
Volunteer
it was pretty smooth yeah yeah it was pretty smooth and it's probably you know having been there for a long time and so you know them knowing me very well and know them very well so he's probably yeah that helped us
Interviewer
what would you just remind me how many employees are in your organization seven okay yes so it's very very yeah but very very tight and and probably maybe Easter to have communication
Volunteer
yeah that's nice no red tape don't you I mean most conversations were directly with the sort of managing directors it was good to have because there's another female director who who does he's responsible for HR and you know she was still there and as well but and she's got a family so I think it was good that she was so fair as well having been through through that herself and but not while she was with a company so
Interviewer
so just from kind of what I'm hearing and I know that it's all about you know what organization and who's that the organization but but would you say that maybe you would recommend someone who's you know wanting to have both a career and very much be a present parent would you maybe recommend that maybe a smaller or organization might be the way to go or might be beneficial
Volunteer
It's tricky because I have insight into other organizations as a recruiter yeah but I have not actually worked anywhere else myself it's hard to tell so and I think yeah I think the not having that sort of bureaucracy in red tape could be beneficial in a smaller organization I think larger companies could probably offer better so benefits and maybe better than sort of Parental leave packages and compared to a smaller one and potentially would have been sort of more organized you know about setting up a plan for going off and returning to work obviously using they have done that more and being a bigger organization but yes I think there's probably pros and cons really yeah
Interviewer
and and I'm curious and I think you're absolutely right you can only speak from your own experience and you've only been kind of an outside perspective which outside perspectives are all always important as well we're sort of rounding up a little bit but I am just curious to know if you feel like any skills that you've developed as being a parent if you have been able to kind of translate that over into your workplace and found that you know that because I am a parent now I can advance or it can do well in my work
Volunteer
and yeah I'd say yeah definitely more representative well 12 parents as well of seeing speaking to them at work but also just generally to people's situations so I think that would be the once of scale and I think it's important I was in my job you know because you have to solve listen and build relationships and that sort of thing and you're dealing with people so day in day out is quite important yeah that'll help
Interviewer
empathy know that that's that's good we of course an HR we talk about these human people skills and and I think a lot of that comes with being parents and yeah and do you feel now is your as your little boy will write it's a little yeah would you know grow and maybe you know start school in the future and things like that do you feel confident at your organization that you know you will get the support that you need and if they're sick days for my kid or things like that that will very much be respected and understood and supported do you feel like looking ahead at that you're not worried about your I guess role just concerning or just connecting to you being a parent
Volunteer
so I think we had some sort of sick days that we had take off and you know when they first go to Nursery they all basically so we had some of that and the dealt with it pretty well I think there is that trust that you know if I have to look after him I'll probably take a day off we're not when it's not as of an emergency sick day but for example when we had them my husband's parents who look after him a couple of days a week when they were away we both took time off to look after him so we're just you know working at home and doing it at the same time so I think there's that trust there that you know we're both doing the right thing I think with school and yeah so first sick days I do think there is a bit of a guilt there obviously when you know you have to be and you have to be off a lot and when when we had when he was sick before I did try and do some work so far and looking after him and yeah I think with school obviously It's tricky because of his only until what three or clock in the afternoon and yeah but yeah I think that would be I think there would be understanding but I do think that there might be some yeah guilt and you know would have to work hard to do that when we get there but yeah but
Interviewer
feel confident in your organization organization right now that would be something that you would be able to work out even if yeah everything takes work but yeah
Interviewer
and you don't have any plans of of changing your career or going anywhere else because of because of this you feel very much comfortable supported and and good where you are at yeah yeah yeah not for now and you have and you feel like you have the opportunities you know now you have the promotion but then all so yeah yeah I think it was even think probably kind of reached unless we saw grow so exponentially in the next few years but
Volunteer
yes I said because I do appreciate that work-life balance of things for for now yeah I'd probably look to stay really yeah
Interviewer
well that's that's wonderful do you have just as a final kind of thought or do you have any final thoughts anything that you feel like when we talk about these topics and talk talk about parents mothers fathers you know and and re-entry specifically do you have any advice or any anything I mean I like I said I did see your article about the points and I thought those were great but do you have anything else that you think you would just pinpoint or highlight as a support or as a advice for other parents in similar situation
Volunteer
think yeah I think we shouldn't feel guilty about having to look after our children I think it's on the sort of government and you know employers to to provide more support really in this definitely more like it can be done and painted it pretty so he picture but I I do know of people who you know have problems when they come back you know the noble to return stuff part-time like the one to all the difference of different roles and that they've done one and things like that and I know so from the mums from the NCT group some of them you know don't Phyllis supported and they are looking for you know to leave their organization so
Interviewer
well that kind of leads me into my kind of last question too of just do you know anybody who would be interested in you know talking to me about their experience that I have a very different experience that you have and and just you know if if you it's totally your thing and you know you could just if you know anybody that would be interesting and I would totally be willing to to listen and would love to put some of their perspectives in as well you know just reach out to me or let them know that I am doing this research because I do think that it's important that you know I think it's important to hear maybe success stories like yours some of this has worked and I feel good about my my career but then also the parents who have not been fortunate to feel supported or feel this way so feel free to just you know send long my information or anything if they are interesting yeah and then any final for an organization if you were on the more you know HR you were in charge of parents going on leave what would you what would you focus on what would be kind of your main focus for supporting them
Volunteer
maternity pay and print leave I think you know it's not good at all and yes I'd say you know make sure that you support that way but yeah offering that flexibility and understanding really around you know being a carer for a child and yeah the flexibility that people may need to think okay yeah that's important so
Interviewer
more of a change in the government side of things then rather than organizations or of course organizations need to to make changes too but you feel like it's more of a core change that needs to be needs to have or what financial aid as
Volunteer
enhanced you know actually package that would be on the organization and understand the you know the government can't pay and as much but yeah I do think the governments what they paid needs to be increased but also you know organizations need to increase their offering and because yeah I think probably most still just offer offer their statutory payments so but yeah and and that understanding and flexibility really and because yeah I think people like myself that are offered those things obviously they are more likely to stay with a company it's a retention tool really isn't it and also a Tracker you are hiring as an organization but yeah
Interviewer
well wonderful thank you so much for your answers we're about up with time but you're you're you feel good about this you feel like there's nothing yeah yeah
